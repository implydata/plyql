# [ DEPRECATED ] PlyQL

A SQL-like interface to plywood

⛔️ This project has been deprecated due to [SQL support in Druid](http://druid.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql).


## Installation

PlyQL is built on top of node so make sure you have node >= 4.x.x installed.

```
npm install -g plyql
```

The global install will make the `plyql` command available system wide.

## Usage

Currently only queries to Druid are supported. More support will come in the future. 

The CLI supports the following options:

Option                     | Description
---------------------------|-----------------------------------------
`--help`                   | print this help message
`--version`                | display the version number
`-v`, `--verbose`          | display the queries that are being made
`-h`, `--host`             | the host to connect to
`-s`, `--source`           | use this source for the query (supersedes FROM clause)

`-t`, `--timeout`          | the time before a query is timed out in ms (default: 60000)
`-r`, `--retry`            | the number of tries a query should be attempted on error, 0 = unlimited, (default: 2)
`-c`, `--concurrent`       | the limit of concurrent queries that could be made simultaneously, 0 = unlimited, (default: 2)
`--rollup`                 | use rollup mode [COUNT() -> SUM(count)]

* JOIN support
* Window functions
